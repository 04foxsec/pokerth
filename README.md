# PokerTH
PokerTH is an open-source Texas hold 'em simulator that runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Android. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PokerTH)

PokerTH has multiple multiplayer options. 
- Internet game (connect to a public or private headless server)[LINK](headless.md)
- Local hosted game [LINK](clientsrv.md)

Unfortunately there is no (or limited) documentation about the headless server and how it should work but after few hours of digging I've figured out.

Hope it helps!
