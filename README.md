I'm home. As everyone else too(2020-2021). Visiting friends, work mates and family is limited. Communication and socializing went almost 100% on-line. People starving do do something with their friends besides Chat and Video calls. There are lots of sites that provide on-line games (and that is great), but sometimes we need something different, something private, which is just ours. :)

PokerTH is a nice open-source [Texas hold 'em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em) simulator which has multiple multiplayer options. 
- Internet game (connect to a public or private headless server)[LINK](headless.md)
- Local hosted game [LINK](clientsrv.md)

Unfortunately there is no (or limited) documentation about the headless server and how it should work but after few hours of diffing I've figured out.

Hope it helps!
